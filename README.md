## Python video streamer personal project

This program allows the user to stream video over the internet straight to VLC. It does this by connecting to a Google spreadsheet that contains a list of the videos available to play, and where they are located on your own Linux server.  

In order to use this you must set up your own google spreadsheet, and provide your own Linux server to hold the video files you want to stream.

Instructions on how to set this up will come later.
