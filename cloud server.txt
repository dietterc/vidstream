IDEAS:

User friendly logins
script to make downloading really easy (python?)
	- each series has a tag (ex: 'hunterxhunter')
	- so putting in 'hunterxhunter 10' downloads 10th episode of hxh
	- episode ranges? (1-10, all, first, etc)

bat file that does the above?


Client side mainly 
asks for input, then translates the input into a link, then connects to the server 
Connected to a spreadsheet for matching links 
spreadsheet format could be:
searchterm path num-episodes(or array of episodes) 
or
searchterm -a alias-number 	//used so we could have multiple serch terms for the same show 
				//alias number is the cell distance to the cell with the path 


TODO: -----------

fix 32bit vs 64bit vlc installs 
Add flavour and alias box 
add config file -- YAML

---------- What I want to be able to do: -------------

import from within the main program. 
Remove from the main program 

feedback while typing a show 
	press 'a' - show a list of all shows that have start with able
	press 'at' - show shows that start with at 
	etc. 

user accounts? - login when the program opens 
	different accounts given to whoever I give this too? 
	only certian accounts can add/remove shows 
	so I can see whos using it and revoke access 

Option to open the video locally (not vlc) 

Let the user fill in the path to vlc themselves 

press enter to auto play 

cover art per show

play next episode button

auto update the last watched
	so I dont have to restart the program to see it
